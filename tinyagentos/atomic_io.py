"""Crash-safe file writes.

A plain ``Path.write_text`` truncates the target and streams the new bytes
into the page cache.  If the machine loses power before those pages reach
the disk, the file's *metadata* (size, mtime) can be durable while its
*data* is not — the file comes back the right length and full of NUL bytes.

That is not theoretical.  On 2026-08-21 an unclean power-off left the taOS
account store (``data/.auth_user.json``) as 901 NUL bytes with an intact
size and mtime, which the auth layer read as "no users exist" and answered
with the first-run onboarding screen.  The device was mounted
``data=writeback``, which widens the window, but ``data=ordered`` only
orders data *that has been submitted* — it does not make a bare write
durable either.

``atomic_write_text`` closes the window the only way that works: write a
sibling temp file, ``fsync`` it so the bytes are on the platter, then
``os.replace`` (atomic within a directory) and ``fsync`` the directory so
the rename itself is durable.  A crash at any point leaves either the
complete old file or the complete new one — never a half-written or
NUL-filled one.
