    # KV cache quantization support exposed as separate K and V type lists

    # plus Ziskind empirical) shows asymmetric K/V is the correct default:
    # keys need more bits than values because softmax amplifies key-side
    # noise, while values are linearly combined. Qwen2.5 breaks with turbo K
    # unless boundary layers are kept at fp16.

    # predate these fields are treated as fp16-only.
