"""Scheduler — dispatcher across registered Resources.

Phase 1 is deliberately minimal: tasks are routed synchronously in the
order of their preferred_resources list, the first resource that passes
admission runs it, and every dispatch is recorded to a bounded history
for the Activity app.

Priority-queue sharing across resources, task aging, mid-task preemption,
and max_wait_ms enforcement are Phase 2 work and intentionally absent
here — adding them before the single-resource path is proven would mask
the simpler bugs.
