"""``atomic_create_bytes``: durable *create-if-absent* for one-time key material.

``atomic_write_bytes`` is a durable *replace* -- exactly right for a state file
that any writer may legitimately overwrite, and exactly wrong for the one-time
creation of persistent key material.  Two processes sharing a data dir can both
observe an absent ``.secrets_key`` (or ``hub/identity.json``), both generate,
and both write.  Each write is atomic, so the file is never corrupt, but the
last one wins: the *losing* process carries on using key material that is not on
disk, and every secret it encrypted becomes unreadable after a restart.

The fix is a primitive that cannot replace: the name is claimed with
``os.link``, which fails ``EEXIST`` instead of clobbering, so exactly one
writer's bytes are ever persisted and every other writer is handed those same
bytes back.
